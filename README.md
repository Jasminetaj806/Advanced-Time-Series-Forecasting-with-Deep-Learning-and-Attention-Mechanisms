# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-Mechanisms

📌 Project Overview
This project implements an advanced deep learning model with an Attention Mechanism for time series forecasting.
A synthetic time series dataset containing trend, multiple seasonal patterns, and Gaussian noise is programmatically generated.
An LSTM-based neural network with a custom Attention layer is built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras and compared with baseline models.
